ADVICE TYPES

There are four types of advices -
BEFORE ADVICE

It runs before the method.
AFTER ADVICE

It runs after the execution of a method. It does not matter if the method ran successfully or an exception was thrown. It is similar to a "finally" block.
AFTER RETURNING ADVICE

In case you want the Advice to be triggered only if the method normally executes without throwing any exception, you can use After Returning advice.
AFTER THROWING ADVICE

In case you want the Advice to be triggered only if the method throws any exception, you can use After Throwing advice.
AROUND ADVICE

If you want some piece of code to be executed before and after a method is called, then you can use Around advice. This is the most powerful kind of advice. Around advice can perform custom behavior both before and after the method invocation.

It’s also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by providing its own return value or throwing an exception.

**Run Time weaving :**

In Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), the Proxy Pattern helps manage cross-cutting concerns by providing a way to handle additional functionality without modifying the core logic of an application. Here’s how it fits in AOP terms:
AOP Terms:

    Core Concern (Business Logic): This is the main functionality of your application. For example, if you have a service that processes orders, the core concern would be the logic for processing those orders.

    Cross-Cutting Concern (Aspect): These are functionalities that affect multiple parts of your application, such as logging, security, or transactions. In AOP, these are managed using aspects.

    Proxy (Interceptor): In AOP, a proxy or interceptor is an object that wraps around the core concern to add or modify behavior. The proxy controls access to the core concern and applies aspects like logging or security checks.

How It Works:

    Define the Core Concern: You have a service, such as OrderService, which has methods like processOrder.

    Define Aspects: You create aspects to handle cross-cutting concerns. For example, a logging aspect that logs every method call and a security aspect that checks if a user has permission to process orders.

    Proxy Creation: Instead of calling OrderService directly, a proxy (interceptor) is used. This proxy wraps around OrderService and manages the application of aspects.

    Method Invocation: When a method on OrderService is called, the proxy intercepts the call. It can perform additional actions defined by the aspects (e.g., log the method call or check security permissions) before delegating the call to the actual OrderService.


**Compile Time Weaving:**

Code Compilation: During the build process, the AOP framework’s compiler (or a special plugin for the existing compiler) takes the source code and aspect definitions and weaves them together. This means it modifies the bytecode of the classes to include the additional functionality specified by the aspects.
