Incase you try deleting the student like this :

You will get error stating, trying to remove a detached instance.
The reason why you are getting detached exception is that finding a student in the first transaction and deleting a student in the second transaction if you want to make these two transaction objects work together you need to merge them into a single persistence context using the merge method so to replace the delete method with the following code:

This above code will merge the persistence context of both the found student and the student that is to be deleted.
