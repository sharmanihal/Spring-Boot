@RestController declares the class as a REST Controller. It combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, Controller annotation allows a class to handle HTTP requests and return views.
Meanwhile, ResponseBody converts the controller method's return value into JSON or XML and sends it back to the client as part of the HTTP response.
@RequestMapping sets the base URL for all endpoints of the controller.
