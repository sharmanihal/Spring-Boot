Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications. In simple terms, it is an attack where a malicious website tricks your browser into performing actions on another site where you are logged in, without your consent or knowledge.

Here's how it works:

    Logged In: Imagine you are logged into your online bank account in one tab of your browser.

    Malicious Website: Meanwhile, you visit a malicious website in another tab. This site is set up by an attacker to exploit CSRF.

    Tricking the Browser: The malicious site sends a request to the bank’s website using your browser. Because you're logged in, your browser includes your credentials (like a session cookie) with this request.

    Unauthorized Actions: The bank’s website receives the request and processes it as if it were coming from you. This could lead to unauthorized actions, such as transferring money or changing account details.

The key issue is that the bank’s website cannot distinguish between legitimate requests from you and the forged requests from the attacker. This happens because your browser automatically includes your credentials with requests, assuming they are all legitimate.

Prevention Measures:

    CSRF Tokens: Websites can include unique tokens in forms or requests. If the token is missing or incorrect, the request is rejected.
