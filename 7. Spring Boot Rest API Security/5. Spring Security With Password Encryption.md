So in Bcrypt :
1. A random hash salt is added to the end of the password generated.
2. When the user provides the password to check if it's legit or not, an old generated password will be used to get the salt value.
3. The provided password will be used to generate the encrypted password using salt, which will be compared with the encrypted one stored in the database.
4. If the provided password is good, it will generate the same password as stored in the database, otherwise not.
