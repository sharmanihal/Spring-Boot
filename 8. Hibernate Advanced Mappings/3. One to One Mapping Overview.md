A one-to-one mapping in a database refers to a relationship where each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table. 
This is useful for splitting data into multiple tables to maintain modularity or for security reasons, such as separating sensitive information.

The below example is a unidirectional relationship: A unidirectional relationship implies that one table knows about the other, but the reverse is not true. 
Typically, this means one table has a foreign key pointing to another table, but there is no corresponding reference back.

In One to One Mapping, we tell hibernate :
1. We have a foreign key named "Instructor_detail_id" to join on some tables.
2. What is that some table? we tell that using **private InstructorDetail instructorDetail**.
3. Hibernate will go out and map this foreign key to the primary key of the InstructorDetail table, so that for each Instructor entity we have its associated InstructorDetail Entity mapped to it.

Entity Lifecycle:
It is the set of states that a hibernate entity can go through in your application.

This is related to cascade where if we save a instructor , associated instructor details will also be saved and same for delete.
