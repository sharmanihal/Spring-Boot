A one-to-one mapping in a database refers to a relationship where each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table. 
This is useful for splitting data into multiple tables to maintain modularity or for security reasons, such as separating sensitive information.

The below example is a unidirectional relationship: A unidirectional relationship implies that one table knows about the other, but the reverse is not true. 
Typically, this means one table has a foreign key pointing to another table, but there is no corresponding reference back.
