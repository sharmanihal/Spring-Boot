Unidirectional Relation: we will be able to go from Course to its review, but not from review to course 

In one-to-one mapping of Instructor to InstructorDetail, the Instructor table had the foreign key instructor_detail_id in it, which is why we added the join column (@JoinColumn(name = "instructor_detail_id")) on the Instructor table and @OneToOne(mappedBy = "instructorDetail") in the InstructorDetail for bidirectional mapping.

Similarly, for Instructor and Course one-to-many mapping, the Course table had the instructor_id, and we kept @JoinColumn(name = "instructor_id") in the Course entity and @OneToMany(mappedBy = "instructor") in the Instructor entity.

But why, in the case of one-to-many unidirectional, even though the foreign key is on the Review side (course_id), do we keep the @JoinColumn(name = "course_id") on the Course side, even though it does not have the foreign key in the Course table to the Review table?

Answer:

The @JoinColumn annotation specifies the details of the foreign key column in the database that is used to establish the relationship between the parent and child entities. Here's how it operates:

    Specifies Foreign Key Column Name: By placing the @JoinColumn annotation on the List<Review> reviews field in the Course entity, you are indicating that there should be a foreign key column in the Review table to link each review back to a Course.

    Controls Column Name: The name attribute of @JoinColumn (e.g., name = "course_id") specifies the name of the foreign key column in the Review table.

    Logical Consistency: The @JoinColumn annotation in the parent entity code logically organizes the mapping configuration in the place where it is most relevant for application developers.
