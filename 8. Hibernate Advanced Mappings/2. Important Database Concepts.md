Example: Customers and Orders
Consider two tables: Customers (parent) and Orders (child). Each order belongs to a customer, so the Orders table has a customer_id foreign key referencing the Customers table's customer_id primary key.

Without cascade: If you try to delete a customer who has orders, you'll likely encounter an error because deleting the customer would leave orphaned orders.

With ON DELETE CASCADE: Deleting a customer would also delete all their associated orders, maintaining data consistency. Â  

ON UPDATE CASCADE
Imagine the customer with ID 123 changing their ID from 123 to 1234. If the customer_id column in the Orders table is set to ON UPDATE CASCADE, then updating the customer's ID in the parent table will automatically update all the old customer id to new customer id. This ensures that the order records always reference the correct customer information.

In case of many to many: If we delete a student should we delete the course as well? Well no, so this cascade delete depends on use-to-use bases.

**Unidirectional Relationship**

Definition: A unidirectional relationship exists when data can be accessed from one table to another, but not vice versa. There's a clear one-way dependency.
Example: Consider an Orders table and a Customers table. Each order belongs to a customer, but a customer might have many orders.
Table Structure:

Orders table: order_id, customer_id, order_date, ...
Customers table: customer_id, customer_name, address, ...
Explanation:

The Orders table has a customer_id foreign key referencing the Customers table's customer_id. This allows you to find the customer for a given order.
However, there's no direct way to find all orders for a given customer without querying the Orders table.

**Bidirectional Relationship**
Definition: A bidirectional relationship allows data access in both directions. There's a mutual dependency between the tables.
Example: Consider an Employees table and a Departments table. An employee belongs to a department, and a department has many employees.
Table Structure:

Employees table: employee_id, department_id, employee_name, ...
Departments table: department_id, department_name, ...
Explanation:

The Employees table has a department_id foreign key referencing the Departments table's department_id.
This allows you to find the department for a given employee.
Additionally, you can find all employees in a specific department by querying the Employees table based on the department_id.


Unidirectional: A child has one parent (biological). You can find the parent of a child, but not all children of a parent without additional information.
Bidirectional: A married couple. Both partners are spouses to each other. You can find the spouse of either partner.
