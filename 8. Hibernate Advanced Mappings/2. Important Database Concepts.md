Example: Customers and Orders
Consider two tables: Customers (parent) and Orders (child). Each order belongs to a customer, so the Orders table has a customer_id foreign key referencing the Customers table's customer_id primary key.

Without cascade: If you try to delete a customer who has orders, you'll likely encounter an error because deleting the customer would leave orphaned orders.

With ON DELETE CASCADE: Deleting a customer would also delete all their associated orders, maintaining data consistency. Â  

ON UPDATE CASCADE
Imagine the customer with ID 123 changing their ID from 123 to 1234. If the customer_id column in the Orders table is set to ON UPDATE CASCADE, then updating the customer's ID in the parent table will automatically update all the old customer id to new customer id. This ensures that the order records always reference the correct customer information.

In case of many to many: If we delete a student should we delete the course as well? Well no, so this cascade delete depends on use-to-use bases.

In relational databases, relationships between tables can be unidirectional or bidirectional. Understanding these concepts is important for designing efficient database schemas and ensuring that data integrity is maintained.

**Unidirectional Relationship**

A unidirectional relationship implies that one table knows about the other, but the reverse is not true. Typically, this means one table has a foreign key pointing to another table, but there is no corresponding reference back.

**Example: Unidirectional Relationship**

Consider the following example with `Authors` and `Books`, where each book has an author, but the author table doesn't have direct information about the books.
In this setup, the `Books` table knows which `Author` each book belongs to, but the `Authors` table doesn't have a direct way to access books.

**Bidirectional Relationship**

A bidirectional relationship implies that each table is aware of the other, allowing navigation in both directions. This is often implemented using foreign keys in both tables.

**Example: Bidirectional Relationship**

Consider `Students` and `Advisors` where each student has an advisor, and each advisor knows their students.

Unidirectional: A child has one parent (biological). You can find the parent of a child, but not all children of a parent without additional information.
Bidirectional: A married couple. Both partners are spouses to each other. You can find the spouse of either partner.
