This is bi-directional mapping, where we can find a course from the instructor and also an instructor from a course.

>> what happend if we do not add this function ?

If you did not use this function, then the developer would have to essentially replicate this code each time they wanted to add a course to an instructor. Instead of replicating code, I created a reusable method. This is a best practice to help reduce the amount of coding in a project.



You may wonder? Why convenience methods and what are there purpose???

In Java, a convenience method is a method that is designed to simplify a particular task or operation, making it easier for programmers to achieve their goals with less code and effort. Convenience methods are typically provided as part of libraries, classes, or utility methods to abstract away complex or repetitive tasks, improving the usability of the programming language and its associated frameworks.

Convenience methods often encapsulate common patterns or operations, allowing developers to avoid writing the same code multiple times and reducing the chances of errors. These methods can improve code readability, maintainability, and overall development efficiency.



Here are a few characteristics of convenience methods in Java:

Simplification: Convenience methods simplify the usage of certain features or operations by providing a higher-level abstraction. This helps programmers avoid dealing with low-level details and intricacies.



Reduction of Boilerplate Code: They reduce the need for writing repetitive or boilerplate code, making the codebase cleaner and more concise.



Common Operations: Convenience methods often encapsulate frequently performed operations, such as string manipulation, collection manipulation, date and time formatting, I/O operations, and more.



Default Behavior: Some convenience methods provide default behavior that can be customized using method parameters or configuration options. This allows developers to quickly achieve common tasks while still having the flexibility to modify behavior when needed.



Error Prevention: By encapsulating complex logic or operations within a convenience method, potential sources of errors are minimized, as developers don't need to recreate the logic each time.



Usability: Convenience methods make it easier for developers to use a library or framework by offering intuitive and straightforward methods for common use cases.



In summary, convenience methods in Java are designed to simplify programming tasks by encapsulating common operations, reducing code duplication, and improving the overall developer experience. They are an essential part of many libraries and frameworks, contributing to the effectiveness and efficiency of Java programming.
