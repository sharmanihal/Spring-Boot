This is bi-directional mapping, where we can find a course from the instructor and also an instructor from a course.

Why do we need this convenience method?
Since Instructor can have multiple course (one to many) everytime we wanted to add Course to the Instructor ,we would have to write the above code,
instead of doing that we have encapsulated this code into a function, that will take care of adding the Course to Instructor and also the vice versa.
