This won't delete the course because of the cascde remove is not part our cascade stratergy.

**Question ? why are we able to get course even tho instructor and course have lazy fetch type**

In Java Persistence API (JPA), the LAZY fetch type is a hint to the persistence provider that the associated entities should not be loaded from the database until they are actually accessed. However, there are scenarios where a LAZY association might be initialized and loaded even without direct access.
Why getCourses() Works Despite LAZY Fetch Type:

    Persistence Context:
        When you call entityManager.find(Instructor.class, id), the Instructor object is loaded into the persistence context.
        If the persistence context needs to perform certain operations that implicitly access the courses collection (such as cascades), it may trigger the loading of the courses.

    Transactional Boundaries:
        The method is annotated with @Transactional, which means it runs within a transaction boundary.
        The transaction ensures that the entity remains managed, and any access to the entity’s lazy associations will be handled by the persistence provider within this transaction.

    Hibernate Specific Behavior:
        Some JPA providers, like Hibernate, may load lazy associations during the removal of the parent entity to ensure that all associated entities are handled correctly.
        Hibernate might automatically initialize lazy collections when performing operations like cascade deletes to ensure referential integrity.

**Question ? Why we not have to call merge method on course to set the instructor as null ?**


When to Use merge ?

The merge method is used in scenarios where you have a detached entity that you want to update. This might occur if:

    You modify an entity outside of a transaction.
    You retrieved an entity in a different transaction (or session in Hibernate) and need to reattach it to the current persistence context.


    In JPA, the merge method is used to update an entity instance that is detached from the persistence context. However, in the code snippet you provided, the Instructor and Course entities are managed by the persistence context within the @Transactional method. Here’s why you don’t need to call merge to set the instructor to null on the Course instances:
Managed Entities

    Persistence Context:
        When you retrieve the Instructor entity using entityManager.find(Instructor.class, id), it becomes a managed entity within the persistence context because the operation is inside a transactional boundary.
        Managed entities are automatically tracked by the persistence context, so any changes you make to them are detected and synchronized with the database when the transaction commits.

    Automatic Change Tracking:
        Since the instructor and its associated courses are managed, any modifications to their state are automatically tracked. This includes setting the instructor property of each Course to null.
        When you set course.setInstructor(null), this change is immediately recognized by the persistence context, and there is no need to call merge to persist this change.

    Transaction Commit:
        At the end of the transaction, JPA automatically flushes changes to the database. The persistence provider will generate the appropriate SQL to update the instructor field of each Course to null and remove the Instructor entity.
